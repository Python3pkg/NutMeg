Filter vidstabdetect
  Extract relative transformations, pass 1 of 2 for stabilization (see vidstabtransform for pass 2).
    Inputs:
       #0: default (video)
    Outputs:
       #0: default (video)
vidstabdetect AVOptions:
  result            <string>     ..FV.... path to the file used to write the transforms (default "transforms.trf")
  shakiness         <int>        ..FV.... how shaky is the video and how quick is the camera? 1: little (fast) 10: very strong/quick (slow) (from 1 to 10) (default 5)
  accuracy          <int>        ..FV.... (>=shakiness) 1: low 15: high (slow) (from 1 to 15) (default 15)
  stepsize          <int>        ..FV.... region around minimum is scanned with 1 pixel resolution (from 1 to 32) (default 6)
  mincontrast       <double>     ..FV.... below this contrast a field is discarded (0-1) (from 0 to 1) (default 0.25)
  show              <int>        ..FV.... 0: draw nothing; 1,2: show fields and transforms (from 0 to 2) (default 0)
  tripod            <int>        ..FV.... virtual tripod mode (if >0): motion is compared to a reference reference frame (frame # is the value) (from 0 to INT_MAX) (default 0)
